It is possible that the booking you make through the
automated booking system may occur at a time where
we are already booked out.<br><br>
This probably won't happen, but is technically possible (for example if someone else is making a booking for the same time <i>right now</i>)
so we want to warn you about it.
If this is the case we will contact you ASAP to discuss options.

      <b>Friday/Saturday Night</b><br>
      <div>Your booking falls during our busiest time on Friday or Saturday night! This means that a few different rules apply as it's prone to get very busy.</div>

      {% if object.party_size > 7 %}
      <div>Unless it's closing time, we'll try as best as we can to never disrupt your game BUT <b>important:</b> if you have quite a large group on a busy night <b>after 2 or 3 hours</b> we may ask you to move or reshuffle your table. We hope that you and your party can be understanding about this (please be sure to let them know),
as we want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to spend some time at Guild and we're always trying to make sure that the table space is shared around.
<br><br>In our experience after 2-or-so hours the size of the group may have changed and there often is quite a bit of table space going spare. This probably won't happen to you as we don't like to do it, but just letting you know that we may need to.
